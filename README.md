# Clonate Insagram, laravel, MYSQL, JS, tailwind

### Design patter MVC with POO

## I tried copy instagram, adding functionalities how:

-   posts with its comments, likes, saved, description, image
-   view User-profiles, we can follow the user and unfollow
-   edit our profile: password, nick, username, surname, email, etc
-   user-search: find in Database.
-   Register, login and logout.
-   Create profiles with avatar and your nick is unique

## javascript functions

-   modal options of posts
-   use AJAX (fetch) for like, saved, eliminate functionalities(in general)
-   create user-search programmed to find user when you write 2 letters minimally (AJAX)
